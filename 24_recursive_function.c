/*
Recursive function
- function that calls itself is called as recursive function

Advantage:
- Code is simple and clean

Disadvantage:
- Difficult to debug
- Slower because it uses stack for each function call for the recursive loop

Example:
- factorial using recursion
- 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
